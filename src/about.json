  "article": "I graduated from Berklee College of Music with a degree in Film and Video Game Scoring. Since then, I've worked primarily as a church music director. I've done freelance work as a graphic designer and a piano teacher. But I wanted to be challenged. I wanted to get into software—to put in the work to learn something new and exciting, to build applications and solve real problems.\nSo I switched gears.\nI considered returning to school for a degree in Computer Science or signing up for a coding bootcamp. In the end, I chose to teach myself—to make use of online resources, articles, and documentation, podcasts and lectures... to learn the world of JavaScript web development.\nI grew my skills as a programmer for a number of months, and in September, I left my job as a music director to throw myself into software development full time.\nBeing self-taught means that I am resourceful, I'm driven, and I have the discipline to see any project through to the end.",
